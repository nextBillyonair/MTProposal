\begin{abstract}
% \noindent \blindtext
We seek to explore the word alignment problem with the help of neural networks. More specifically, we want to see if the original Expectation-Maximization (EM) approach to word alignment can be transcribed as a neural network in a supervised and unsupervised setting.
\end{abstract}

% REMEMBER IDEA IS TO COPY PROPOSAL INTO FINAL WRITEUP

\section{Introduction}
% WHAT IS OUR METRIC!!!
Word Alignment seeks to match individual words in a parallel corpus such that the Alignment Error Rate (AER) is minimized. In a previous assignment, our task was to implement IBM Model 1, based on the Expectation-Maximization (EM) algorithm. Following IBM Model 1, we implemented a reparametrization of IBM Model 2 that favors alignments along the diagonal. Finally, we implemented an Alignment by Agreement Model that trained a French to English and English to French model and combined the results to make better alignments.

Our proposal for this project is to replace the EM algorithm and reparametrization of IBM Model 2 with a neural network architecture. In addition, the model will incorporate Alignment by Agreement. We will use PyTorch to build the model and loss functions. The key concept is that we can create a loss function that the network will learn the optimal parameters to learn word alignments from a corpus of parallel text.


\section{Background}
Our approach is inspired by current research in topic modeling with Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) models. LDA models are generative probabilistic models that model topics across distributions of words in a corpus. LDAs are based on variational methods and EM for Bayes parameter estimation.

% exoand this section, and say that the work is inspiration to our approach

The boxes are ``plates'' representing replicates. The outer plate represents documents, while the inner plate represents the repeated choice of topics and words within a document. }

Current research attempts to supplant the probabilistic modeling with a neural network architecture.

Additional inspiration comes from Variational Auto-Encoders (VAE).

\section{Original Formulation}
% Can steal shorten version from original paper! yay!
% See if we can shorten or phrase it better. This should just be a reminder of what we did

IBM Model 1 estimates the translation probabilities of the data through the EM algorithm\footnote{\url{http://mt-class.org/jhu/assets/papers/alopez-model1-tutorial.pdf}}. The EM algorithm is useful in discovering and learning the parameters of a latent variable model. In the original IBM Model 1, this is the translation probability distribution $t(e_i|f_j)$.

The work of Dyer et al. \cite{dyer2013simple} added an effective reparameterization of IBM Model 2 to give an alignment distribution $a$. We define for a French sentence \textbf{f} of length $n = |\textbf{f}|$, an English sentence \textbf{e} of length $m=|\textbf{e}|$, with precision parameter $\lambda$, the alignment distribution $a$ as follows:

\begin{equation}
\begin{split}
h(i,j,m,n) = - \left| \frac{i}{m} - \frac{j}{n}\right| \\
\\
a(i,j,m,n) =e^{  \lambda h(i,j,m,n)} \\
\end{split}
\end{equation}

This formulation gives us a position aware distribution that favors alignments towards the diagonal for a given English word $e_i$ and French word $f_j$. The precision parameter $\lambda$ controls how strongly the model prefers the diagonal.

Once we are done training the model, to make an alignment guess, we must find the alignment that returns the maximum probability. For some alignment $a_i$:
\begin{equation}
\hat{a}_i = \argmax_{a_i} \, t(e_{a_i}|f_j) \cdot a(i, j, m, n)
\end{equation}
where $t(e_{a_i}|f_j)$ is the translation probability, and an alignment distribution $a$ with parameters $\lambda$ and $p_0$. This will give us the English word $e_{a_i}$ that is the most likely translation of the French word $f_j$.

Finally, incorporating the Alignment by Agreement model improvement was inspired by the work done by Liang et al. \cite{liang2006alignment}. However, our original implementation was strongly influenced by the pseudocode used in the \texttt{Grow-Diag-Final} Alignment Heuristic by the Moses Statistical Translation System\footnote{\url{http://www.statmt.org/moses/?n=FactoredTraining.AlignWords}}.

We trained an EM model in both directions, one for English to French, $A_{E \rightarrow F}$, and another for French to English, $A_{F \rightarrow E}$. Using the alignments generated by each individual model, we then proceed to take the intersection of each model's alignments.
\begin{equation}
Intersection = A_{E \rightarrow F} \, \bigcap \, A_{F \rightarrow E}
\end{equation}
\begin{equation}
Union = A_{E \rightarrow F} \, \bigcup \, A_{F \rightarrow E}
\end{equation}
This effectively gives us an alignment matrix that both models favor strongly, i.e. agree on. From this intersection matrix, we can then use the \texttt{GROW-DIAG-FINAL} algorithm to fill in the remaining gaps from the union of alignments.


\section{Our Formulation}
% basically regurtiate (nicely) what was on board. Maybe make fancy diagrams and stuff.
% also embeddings, positional, POS tagging, etc.

% refence fig 2
\subsection{Inspiration}
We can formulate the word alignment problem as a probabilistic model, similar to LDAs and VAEs.

We want to use neural networks to encode words, create complex relations and functions to learn the parameters of the underlying distirbution to maximize some likelihood function. We intend to use PyTorch to implement the embedding layers, alignment distribution, and translation weights. In addition, we will encdoe this likelihood function as a loss function that the network will optimze its parameters for, with respect to the distirbution, formulation, and likelihood function.

\subsection{Alignment Distribution}

\begin{tikzpicture}

  % Define nodes

  \node[latent, above=0.75cm of a, xshift=-0.6cm] (lambda) {$\lambda$};
  \node[latent, above=0.75cm of a, xshift=0.6cm]  (null) {$p_0$};
  \node[obs, right=0.75cm of t]            (s) {$s$};
  \node[latent, below=0.95cm of t]            (theta) {$\theta$};

  % Connect the nodes

\caption{Our Probabilistic Plate Diagram for Word Alignment, where $t$ is target, $s$ is source, $\theta$ is the translation model, $\lambda$ is a position distortion parameter, $p_0$ is the null probability, and $a$ is the alignment distribution.}
\end{figure}

We can describe our alignment distribution as a function of target position $i$, source position $j$, and learnable parameters $\lambda$ and $p_0$. Here we define $\lambda$ as the alignment distortion parameter, and $p_0$ and the probability of aligning to the null token. From Dyer's paper, parameter values were selected as $\lambda=4$ and $p_0=0.08$ for the entire corpus, unlike our formulation which would allow the parameters to be updated via backpropagation. As a result, the alignment distribution $a$ can be formulated as such:

% alignment distirbution, i is target position, j is source position, lambda and null p_0
\begin{equation}
a(i, j \, | \, \lambda, p_0) =
\begin{cases}
      p_0 & \text{if } null \\
     (1-p_0) \cdot e^{-\lambda | \frac{i}{m} - \frac{j}{n}|} & \text{else}
   \end{cases}
\end{equation}

\subsubsection{Maximium Likelihood Function}




USEFUL EQUATIONS FOR FUTURE REFERENCE:

Softmax:
\begin{equation}
Softmax(x_i) = \frac{\exp(x_i)}{\sum_j\exp(x_j)}
\end{equation}
\begin{equation}
\sigma_i(\vec{x}) = \frac{\exp(x_i)}{\sum_j\exp(x_j)}
\end{equation}
Log Softmax: % effectively defines word embedding logprobs?
\begin{equation}
\log \left( Softmax(x_i) \right) = x_i - \log \left( \sum_j\exp(x_j) \right)
\end{equation}
\begin{equation}
\log  \sigma_i(\vec{x})  = x_i - \log \left( \sum_j\exp(x_j) \right)
\end{equation}

% MIGHT BE USED
For discrete probability distributions P and Q defined on the same probability space, the Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence from Q to P is defined to be:
\begin{equation}
D _ { \mathrm { KL } } ( P \| Q ) = \sum _ { i } P ( i ) \log \left( \frac { P ( i ) } { Q ( i ) } \right)
\end{equation}
In other words, it is the expectation of the logarithmic difference between the probabilities P and Q, where the expectation is taken using the probabilities P.
